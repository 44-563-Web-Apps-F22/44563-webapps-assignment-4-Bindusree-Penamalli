<h2>Act II RECITATIVE</h2>
<P>LADY S.     What is this fairy form I see before me?
    MR. W.      Oh horrible!—She's going to adore me!
                This last catastrophe is overpowering!
    LADY S.     Why do you glare at one with visage lowering?
                For pity's sake recoil not thus from me!
    MR. W.      My lady leave me—this may never be!
  
                   DUET—LADY SANGAZURE and MR. WELLS
  
    MR. W.      Hate me! I drop my H's—have through life!
    LADY S.           Love me! I'll drop them too!
    MR. W.      Hate me! I always eat peas with a knife!
    LADY S.           Love me! I'll eat like you!
    MR. W.      Hate me! I spend the day at Rosherville!
    LADY S.           Love me! that joy I'll share!
    MR. W.      Hate me! I often roll down One Tree Hill!
    LADY S.           Love me! I'll join you there!
  
    LADY S.     Love me!  My prejudices I will drop!
    MR. W.            Hate me! that's not enough!
    LADY S.      Love me!  I'll come and help you in the shop!
    MR. W.            Hate me! the life is rough!
    LADY S.     Love me! my grammar I will all forswear!
    MR. W.            Hate me! abjure my lot!
    LADY S.     Love me! I'll stick sunflowers in my hair!
    MR. W.            Hate me! they'll suit you not!
